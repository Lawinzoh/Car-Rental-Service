ðŸš— Car Rental Service API
A RESTful API developed with Django and Django REST Framework (DRF) to manage car inventory, handle rental bookings, track user activity, and provide essential backend services for a modern car rental platform.


1. Features
This API supports the following core functionalities:

Inventory Management: Full CRUD operations for cars (make, model, year, price, status).

User Management: Registration and profile management for customers.

Rental System: Dedicated endpoints for booking a car (with start/end dates) and managing returns.

Availability Checks: Logic to prevent double bookings.

History & Status: Retrieval of a user's current rentals and complete rental history.

Search & Filter: Advanced querying of the car list by make, model, year, price, and availability.

Authentication: Secure user authentication and authorization (via DRF).

6. Project Structure
The project is modularized into core functional apps:

Car-Rental-Service/
â”œâ”€â”€ CarRentalService/          # Project settings/config (settings.py, urls.py)
â”œâ”€â”€ users/                     # Manages Custom User model and authentication
â”œâ”€â”€ vehicles/                  # Manages the Car model and inventory logic
â”œâ”€â”€ rentals/                   # Manages the Rental model and booking logic
â”œâ”€â”€ manage.py                  # Django's command-line utility
â””â”€â”€ venv/                      # Virtual environment
7. Timeline & Status
