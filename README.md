1. Features
This API supports the following core functionalities:

Inventory Management: Full CRUD operations for cars (make, model, year, price, status).

User Management: Registration and profile management for customers.

Rental System: Dedicated endpoints for booking a car (with start/end dates) and managing returns.

History & Status: Retrieval of a user's current rentals and complete rental history.

Search & Filter: Advanced querying of the car list by make, model, year, price, and availability.

Secure Authentication: Token-based authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
